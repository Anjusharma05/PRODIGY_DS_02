# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the classic [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The aim is to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
- Clean the data (handle missing values, drop irrelevant features)
- Explore relationships between key variables (e.g., gender, class, age)
- Visualize distributions and trends
- Discover patterns that influenced survival outcomes

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `train.csv` – training data from Kaggle
- `test.csv` – test data for predictions (not directly used in EDA)
- `gender_submission.csv` – sample submission file
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook performing full EDA
- `README.md` – project overview and documentation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Google Colab for code execution

---

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA

- **Gender**: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Passenger Class**: Higher-class passengers (1st class) were more likely to survive.
- **Age**: Younger passengers, especially children, had higher chances of survival.
- **Embarkation Port**: Port of embarkation showed slight variation in survival rates.
- **Fare**: Higher fare correlated slightly with higher survival, likely due to class.
